CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) : Add Beautification to our web page
Syntax:

Selector{Property: value;}

Selector is used to select a tag where we want to apply styles.

Types of Selectors:
(All selectors use style attribute in the head part)

                    1. Universal Selector(*): By using Universal selector we are able to apply styles to the entire body part.
                    
                    2. Identifier Selector(#): To use identifier Selector we have to mention a id with name in the tag,identifiers are unique.
                    3. Class Selector (.): To use class Selector we have to mention class with name in the tag,we can use any number of identifiers in a single class(class mostly used in External Css)
                    4. Descendant Selector: Descendant Selector is used we are able to apply style to the tag present in the child and the child present in the parent class
                        .parent>#child(h2)
                    5. child combiner : Child combiner and Descendant Selector are same but different in the syntax only
                        .parent #child(h2)
Types of css:
                 1. Inline css : Inline css is used to apply style within a tag (without using any selector)
